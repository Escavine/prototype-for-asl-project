# prototype-for-asl-project
This is for my A level Computer Science project, which is essentially an abstracted version of my full scale sign language detection project.



There are obviously some flaws with it and the design is too jejune, I won't be using the GUI functionality for my software development rather I'll be creating a 
web application.
